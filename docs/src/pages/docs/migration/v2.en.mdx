# Migrating to v2

## New Features

### The `hasBatchim` function now has additional options.

The `hasBatchim` function has been updated with an `only` option, allowing you to check if a string has a single batchim, double batchim, or any batchim at all.

```tsx
// Check if there is only a single batchim
hasBatchim('감', { only: 'single' });

// Check if there is only a double batchim
hasBatchim('감', { only: 'double' });

// Check if there is a batchim
hasBatchim('감');

## Handling BREAKING CHANGES

### The acronymizeHangul function has been removed.

This function was removed as it was not closely related to Hangul domain needs.
If you need to extract initials, you can use the following method:

```tsx
string.split(' ').map(word => word.charAt(0));
```

### The assembleHangul function has been renamed.


As specified in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/toss/es-hangul/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), the hangul suffix has been removed from the function name.

```tsx
// ASIS
assembleHangul('ㄱ', 'ㅏ', 'ㅁ')

// TOBE
assemble('ㄱ', 'ㅏ', 'ㅁ')
```

### The choseongIncludes and chosungIncludes functions have been removed.

The process of extracting the initial consonants (choseong) is provided by es-hangul, and checking for inclusion can be done with basic JavaScript methods, so these functions have been removed. You can use the getChoseong function to extract choseong, then use the includes method.


```tsx
// ASIS
chosungIncludes('바나나', 'ㅂㄴㄴ');
choseongIncludes('바나나', 'ㅂㄴㄴ');

// TOBE

const choseonged = getChoseing('바나나');
chosunged.includes('ㅂㄴㄴ');
```


### The curriedCombineHangulCharacter function has been removed.

The curriedCombineHangulCharacter function was removed as it was not intended for direct user use.
If needed, you can implement it as follows:

```tsx

export const curriedCombineHangulCharacter=
  (firstCharacter: string) =>
  (middleCharacter: string) =>
  (lastCharacter = '') =>
    combineCharacter(firstCharacter, middleCharacter, lastCharacter);
```


### The combineHangulCharacter function has been renamed.

As specified in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/toss/es-hangul/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), the hangul suffix has been removed from the function name.


```tsx
// ASIS
combineHangulCharacter('ㄱ', 'ㅏ', 'ㅁ')

// TOBE
combineCharacter('ㄱ', 'ㅏ', 'ㅁ')
```


### The convertQwertyToHangulAlphabet function has been renamed.
 

As specified in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/toss/es-hangul/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), the hangul suffix has been removed from the function name.


```tsx
// ASIS
convertQwertyToHangulAlphabet('r')

// TOBE
convertQwertyToAlphabet('r')
```

### The disassembleHangul, disassembleHangulToGroups, and disassembleCompleteHangulCharacter functions have been renamed.

As specified in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/toss/es-hangul/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), the hangul suffix has been removed from the function name.



```tsx
// ASIS
disassembleHangul('감');
disassembleHangulToGroups('감');
disassembleCompleteHangulCharacter('감');

// TOBE
disassemble('감');
disassembleToGroups('감');
disassembleCompleteCharacter('감');
```

### The `extractHangul` function has been removed.

It was removed as it is not closely related to the Hangul domain.<br/>

### The `hangulIncludes` function has been removed.

It was removed as it is not closely related to the Hangul domain.<br/>

If needed, you can use the following method:

```tsx
function hangulIncludes(x: string, y: string) {
  const disassembledX = disassembleHangul(x);
  const disassembledY = disassembleHangul(y);

  return disassembledX.includes(disassembledY);
}

### The function name removeLastHangulCharacter has been changed.

As specified in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/toss/es-hangul/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), the hangul suffix has been removed from the function name.


```tsx
// ASIS
removeLastHangulCharacter('감');

// TOBE
removeLastCharacter('감');
```

### The hasProperty and hasValueInReadOnlyStringList functions have been removed.


They were removed as they are not closely related to the Hangul domain.

If needed, you can use the following method:

```tsx
export function hasValueInReadOnlyStringList<T extends string>(list: readonly T[], value: string): value is T {
  return list.some(item => item === value);
}

export function hasProperty<T extends object, K extends PropertyKey>(obj: T, key: K): key is K & keyof T {
  return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, key);
}

```

### The hasSingleBatchim function has been removed.


The hasBatchim function now accepts an option to handle this use case.

```tsx
// ASIS
hasSingleBatchim('감');

// TOBE
hasBatchim('감', { only: "single" });
```
